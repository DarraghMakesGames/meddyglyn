  description: "Dear brewer - it is I, High Arcanoclast Florian. Plague has struck
    Matzig. Dozens have died already, and hundreds more are bedridden. I fear that
    if we do not find a cure, the city and Duchy both will fall. I have sought wisdom
    from my texts and found reference to an ancient drink called Meddyglyn. I believe
    it is a kind of mead with healing properties. It is my hope that if you recreate
    it, we can halt the spread of this plague. My texts refer to it as having strong
    Floral flavours, Average Earthy and Green flavours, Average Peppery flavour,
    Strong Tart flavour, and Average Citrus and Sour flavours. I believe it also
    had a High Alcohol content and had to be aged for at least 5. Please create at
    least 50L of this recipe, and with the Light\u2019s blessing, it will have some
    effect."

  failureText: This brew has had no effect. The sick grow sicker, the there are more
    struck by the plague every day. Please, brewer! Try again! The Meddyglyn is our
    only hope!
  passText: "Brewer\u2026 It is a miracle. I believe you have recreated the most
    sacred Meddyglyn! Those who have drunk of it have grown well again. In solidarity,
    we even shared some with our enemies, the Reizveldians, who were sick also. In
    gratitude, a lasting ceasefire has been called. It may be peace for good! You
    have done a wonderful thing, brewer. I have taken the liberty of having the Royal
    Architects build an extension to your brewery, worthy of a master meadmaker.
    I have also included with this missive the Chalice of Convalescence \u2013 it
    has long been a symbol of healing in our faith. Keep it in memory of this deed
    you have done."
