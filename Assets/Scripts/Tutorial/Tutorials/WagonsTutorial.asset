  tutorialText: "Welcome to the Wagon Room. This is where you can complete Contracts
    which you accept from the Contract Board upstairs. While holding mead, simply
    press E on a Wagon to put it inside. If you make a mistake, simply press E with
    an empty hand to retrieve your mead. You can combine different batches, sizes,
    bottles, kegs, etc. freely. As long as they meet the minimum combined size (in
    litres) of the Contract, and all of the different meads in the Wagon meet all
    the Contract\u2019s requirements, you will successfully complete the Contract!
    Once you\u2019re happy with what you\u2019ve put in the Wagon, simply go the
    Fulfilment Sign opposite the Wagon and press E to mark it as complete. You can
    have up to 3 Contracts active at any given time, and each one is assigned to
    its own Wagon & Sign."
