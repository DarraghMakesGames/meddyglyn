  description: "Greetings, brewer. My name is Guard-Captain Albin. I command the
    Duke\u2019s forces here in Matzig. As you know, open conflict has broken out
    between our army and that of Reizveld. Recruitment efforts for the militia have
    been slow. I am planning to host a tourney at the castle \u2013 a test of swordfighting
    ability and bowmanship. Chamberlain Reginal speaks well of your skills. As such,
    I would like to commission you to prepare a brew to be presented as a prize for
    the tourney. Please prepare at least 10L of mead with Strong Alcohol, High Sweetness,
    and some amount of Peppery, Tart and Woody flavours. A proper soldier\u2019s
    brew! Please avoid any Citrus flavour."

  failureText: "What you\u2019ve presented is insufficient as a prize for the tourney.
    It\u2019s imperative that we attract as many potential recruits as possible;
    as such, we need the best of the best. I am disappointed. Both the Chamberlain
    and Spice Merchant Kiera spoke highly of your abilities."
  passText: "What a tourney that was! Nearly a hundred entrants, most of whom signed
    up for the militia that same day. No doubt others from the crowd will follow
    suit. The winner showed immense skill and no doubt he will slay many Reizveld
    invaders. Certainly the quality of the mead on offer as the prize played a role
    in both the number and skill of the entrants. As thanks, I have commissioned
    a local glassblower to craft two new brewing vessels for you, both 10L, which
    I believe is twice as large as your current vessel. I\u2019ve also sent you my
    own personal dagger as a gift. May it keep you safe in these uncertain times."
