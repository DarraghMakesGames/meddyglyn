  description: "Hail, brewer! Is there anything like sitting by the fire, taking
    in the smell of winter spices while it\u2019s snowing outside? I\u2019d like
    to recreate that feeling! Could you please prepare for me 10L of delicious spiced
    mead? It should have an Average Alcohol content. Make sure it has any amount
    of Woody, Peppery and Bitter tastes. Please also age it for at least 5. The age
    is what mellows out the spices, I heard!"

  passText: "Ahh, that\u2019s it exactly. Drinking this makes me feel like I\u2019ve
    got a roading Yuletime fire burning right in my chest. Excellent job, brewer!"
