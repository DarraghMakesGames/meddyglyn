  description: Dearest brewer - my name is Elias. I fear I am nearing my life's end.
    Many years ago I drank of a mead that was truly exotic. It had a strong Floral
    flavour, an average Peppery flavour, and a subtle Citrus flavour. I remember
    thinking it was not Tart at all. It also had a very strong kick to it - it must
    have been high in Alcohol. I was hoping you could recreate this drink for an
    old man on his last legs. I would like 5L, so I may share it with my family.

  passText: Brewer, you have brought me such joy. This brings me back to the days
    of my youth. Thank you. A thousand times, thank you.
