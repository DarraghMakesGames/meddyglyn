  description: 'Greetings, brewer. I have a business meeting arranged with a potential
    new partner. I would like to grease the wheels, so to speak, with some fine mead
    during the meeting. Could you prepare at least 2L of High Alcohol mead with a
    Strong Tart flavour and a Subtle Citrus flavour? '
