  tutorialText: "You\u2019ve unlocked Ingredients! These provide Flavours to your
    brew. By Examining (press R) an ingredient, you can see what Flavour or Flavours
    it will provide. Some ingredients provide just 1 Flavour (for example, Orange
    provides Citrus) while others provide 2 Flavours (Lemons provide Citrus and Sour).
    Ingredients with 2 Flavours add half as much Flavour Strength as Ingredients
    with 1 Flavour. Certain Contracts require specific Flavour Strengths to complete.
    For example, in a 5L Vessel, 1 Orange provides Average Citrus flavour, while
    a Lemon will provide Subtle Citrus and Sour flavours. Experiment with different
    combinations!"
