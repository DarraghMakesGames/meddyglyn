  description: "Brewer \u2013 my brother has taken ill and has not woken for days.
    He has a high fever and refuses food and drink. I worry if not treated soon,
    he will die. I have heard that you have some knowledge of herbs. Could you make
    a mead to treat his fever? Please keep the Alcohol Low. Include Floral, Earthy
    and Green flavours \u2013 ingredients that impart those tastes are said to help
    balance the body\u2019s humours. Can you please make at least 5L?"

    came down and my brother woke at last. Thank you, thank you, thank you. My family
