  tutorialText: "These Storage Racks allow you to easily store and retrieve your
    brews. Bottles can be stored on the top shelves, while Kegs and Barrels (unlocked
    later in the game) can be stored on the bottom shelf. This can be useful if you\u2019re
    waiting for the market to change in your favour, or if you are waiting for a
    brew to age. While you can simply drop your brews on the ground (like an animal),
    it\u2019s neater to use the storage racks."
