  description: Brewmaster, I am High Arcanloclast Florian of the Church of the Holy
    Beacon. It is my duty to ensure the spiritual wellbeing of all the citizens of
    Matzig. Understandably, spirits are low after the recent defeat at the battle
    of the Tansy River. While I am reluctant to resort to pleasures of the flesh,
    the products of your brewery seem to have made quite an impact on the city. Please
    prepare 30L of mead. It should have an Average Alcohol content. Please ensure
    it has strong Peppery flavour, Subtle Woody flavour, and Average Sour flavour.
    It is my understanding that these flavours have medicinal properties. May the
    Light go with you.

    I couldn\u2019t possibly distribute this to my congregation. Don\u2019t you think
    they\u2019ve been through enough?"
  passText: "Blessings on you, brewer. Your mastery of flavours is impressive. My
    flock\u2019s spirits have risen, in no small part thanks to you. Despite some
    of them growing ill from a new sickness I\u2019ve not seen before, I haven\u2019t
    seen so many smiles since the start of the war. In thanks, I have given my herbalists
    permission to supply your brewery with fresh Herbs. I have also included my personal
    journal from my herbalist days \u2013 it contains much knowledge on herbcraft. "
