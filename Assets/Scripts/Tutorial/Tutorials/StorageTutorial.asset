  tutorialText: "This table contains means of storing your finished batches of mead.
    At the moment, you only have access to Bottles, which contain 1 litre each. Buy
    a Bottle by pressing E on the Bottle Storage. While carrying the Bottle, Press
    E while looking at a Vessel that contains a finished batch. This will drain 1L
    of the batch and place it in the Bottle. Press R while holding or looking at
    a Bottle to examine what\u2019s inside! This will show the Sweetness, Alcohol,
    and the strength of any Flavours present. You can then use the Bottle at the
    Sales Counter to sell it on the open market, or in the Wagon Room to complete
    a Contract. Any mead stored in this way will Age. Aging a brew will slightly
    increase its value, and some Contracts will specify a minimum Age."
