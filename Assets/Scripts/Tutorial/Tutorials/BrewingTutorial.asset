  tutorialText: "This is a Brewing Vessel! By adding honey, water, and yeast to this,
    you can make mead. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s working when it starts foaming,
    fizzing and bubbling! This means it is fermenting some of its Sweetness to make
    Alcohol. Note that this may reduce the overall level of Sweetness in the brew!
    Press R to Examine the vessel. This will show you how much Honey and Water have
    been added, how much room is left, as well as the strengths of whatever Flavours
    it may have. Be aware: when you add Water, all Flavours are diluted! Larger Vessels
    (which you\u2019ll unlock later) will require more Ingredients to achieve the
    same strength of flavours as smaller Vessels. However, no matter their size,
    all Vessels require only 1 helping of Yeast to start fermenting! You\u2019ll
    know Fermentation is finished when the foaming and bubbling stops."
