  tutorialText: "You\u2019ve unlocked a larger (10L) Brewing Vessel! The principles
    of brewing are exactly the same, but you may will need more Ingredients to reach
    the same Strengths as a smaller Vessel. For example, while adding 2 Oranges to
    a 5L Vessel will give a \u201CStrong\u201D Citrus Flavour, adding the same amount
    to a 10L Vessel gives only \u201CAverage\u201D Citrus Flavour. Being able to
    brew more mead at once is very helpful, but you\u2019ll need to experiment to
    get your ratios right! As always, adding water dilutes all ingredients but Yeast."
