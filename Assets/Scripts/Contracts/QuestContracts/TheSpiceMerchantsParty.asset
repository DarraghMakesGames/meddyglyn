  description: "Hello there, brewer! I am certain you have heard of me \u2013 I am
    Kiera, preeminent spice merchant of Matzig! My friendship is valuable in this
    city, brewer, and you would do well to court it. As you may know, war has recently
    been declared on the duchy by our closest neighbour, Reizvald. Understandably,
    this has put many of the city\u2019s movers and shakers on edge. I am throwing
    a bit of a get-together to calm nerves. Would you be so kind as to brew some
    mead I can have served? I would like at least 6L of brew, with High Alcohol (11%+),
    a Strong Citrus flavour, and a subtle Sour flavour. I\u2019ll need that aged
    for at least 2 as well. Thank you in advance!"

  failureText: "My, my, brewer! This simply won\u2019t do at all. I couldn\u2019t
    possibly serve this to my guests. As a precaution, I\u2019ve had my maid pour
    the whole lot into the river. Do better next time, won\u2019t you darling?"
  passText: "The brew you sent me is delectable! My guests simply adored it. It was
    just what people needed in this tumultuous time. Between you and I, however,
    Guard-Captain Albin let it slip that Reizveldian forces have been spotted moving
    towards the city. Stay safe, brewer! As thanks for your excellent work, I have
    opened my stores of Spices to you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find they add a
    certain elegance and class to your mead. I\u2019ve also sent you my old Pestle
    and Mortar, as a token of my respect."
