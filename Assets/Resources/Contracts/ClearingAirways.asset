  description: My grandfather has been having terrible trouble with his breathing.
    Could you prepare a brew with strong Peppery and Tart flavours, and high Alcohol?
    Hopefully it will clear his airways! I only need a 1L bottle.

  failureText: Sorry, mate, this isn't what I asked for. This didn't help my grandfather's
    breathing at all.
  passText: Brilliant! After drinking this, my grandfather's breathing came so much
    easier. We'll definitely be back. Thanks so much!
