  description: "Brewer \u2013 the day we all feared has come. Duchess von Reizveld\u2019s
    forces have been spotted en route to the city of Matzig itself. Guard-Captain
    Albin gave me your name as a reliable brewer. I am General Krus. I have been
    tasked with defending the city walls. I would like you to brew me some mead.
    Not to drink \u2013 this mead will be set alight and flung via catapult towards
    the enemy. As such, the Alcohol content needs to be as High as possible. Ensure
    it also has Strong Peppery, Bitter, Sour, Tart and Green flavours. This is to
    heighten any damage it will do it if gets in the bastards\u2019 eyes and wounds.
    You\u2019ll be doing the city a service, brewer \u2013 don\u2019t let me down.
    Bring me at 40L of the stuff."

  failureText: "This won\u2019t do, brewer. We need a batch fit for use as a powerful
    weapon. I\u2019ve sent on what you made to the soldiers\u2019 mess for them to
    drink. I trust you\u2019ll do better next time."
  passText: "Haha, brewer! It was spectacular! Those Reizveldian dogs fled when your
    burning brew rained down on them! Those barrels that we didn\u2019t launch, the
    soldiers drank. That boosted morale, I\u2019ll tell you! Seems like some of the
    enemy was sick with some sort of plague, and many of our own have gotten sick,
    too. I\u2019ll admit, that takes the wind out of our sails a little. Nevertheless!
    I\u2019ve sent on a brand new 20L brewing vessel and commissioned Cooper Jarvik
    to craft some new 10L barrels for you. I hope that helps! I\u2019ve also included
    a pair of bracers we took off a captured Reizveldian officer. Think of them as
    a keepsake!"
