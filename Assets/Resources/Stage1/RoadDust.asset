  description: Hail, brewkeeper. I am a traveller, and I have walked these roads
    for many months. My parched tongue calls out for mead, the drink of my homeland.
    Could you prepare some for me? The style is of no consequence; any mead will
    do. I only ask that you prepare at least 6L for me - enough to bring on my travels.

  failureText: Alas. I had not thought my request was so onerous. My travels will
    be all the poorer for this.
  passText: Many thanks, kind brewer. The taste of your brew brings to mind memories
    of home and will buoy me along in my journeys. Fare thee well, brewer.
