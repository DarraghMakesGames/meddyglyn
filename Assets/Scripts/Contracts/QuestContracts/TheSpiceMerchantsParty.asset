  description: "Greetings! I heard you're the new brewer in town. I occasionally
    hold a soir\xE9e with some of the other local traders, and I'd like to spice
    it up (pardon the pun) with some mead. Could you make me 8L of High Alcohol brew,
    with a strong Citrus flavour and a subtle Sour flavour. Thanks in advance!"
