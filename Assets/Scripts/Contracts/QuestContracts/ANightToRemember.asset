  description: "Brewer \u2013 I believe it is high time I corresponded with you myself.
    I am Duke Ardin von Matzig. Numerous advisors, local businesspeople and townsfolk
    have spoken of your skill, dedication, and perseverance. As you know, the awful
    war with our neighbours has ended and the plague has been cast from our city.
    I would like to commission you to create a batch of mead for the celebratory
    feasts taking place throughout Matzig. Brew for me 80L of the finest mead. High
    in Alcohol, with Strong Floral and Citrus tastes, Average Earthy flavour, and
    a subtle Tart finish. Avoid Bitter flavours at all costs \u2013 we\u2019ve seen
    enough Bitterness for one lifetime. Age the lot for at least 10. Make it a night
    to remember."

  failureText: "Brewer \u2013 not your best work. This won\u2019t do for the celebrations.
    It\u2019s not every day you end a war and a plague, you know. Second best is
    not good enough."
  passText: The celebrations ran long into the night and, indeed, to the next day.
    The city has never seen such wild abandon and joyful carousing. This is your
    finest work, brewer. This mead brought strong men to tears and the multitudes
    to their feet in song and dance. I hereby proclaim you Royal Meadmaker to the
    Ducal family. Your services to the realm will never be forgotten. All business
    fee licences for your brewery are hereby waived in perpetuity. Well done, brewer.
    Well done. I award you the Golden Dragon of Matzig for your services to my family
    and to the Duchy. There is no higher award for civilian service.
