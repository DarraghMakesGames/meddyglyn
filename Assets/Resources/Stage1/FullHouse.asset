  description: Greetings, Brewer - I am Josiah, tavern-keeper of the local inn, the
    Twisted Oak. Business has been good lately, but my stores have run dry - and
    I don't expect another delivery for a week! Could you make me 30L of mead? My
    patrons like Average Alcohol content and Average Sweetness, but they're not fussy
    about the rest.
  time: 0
  reward: 350
  failureText: I've got a lot of unhappy patrons here, Brewer. This is going to put
    a damper on business.
  passText: Thank you, Brewer! I have a taproom full of happy patrons all drinking
    to your health. Keep this up and I might have to take out a permanent order!
