  description: "Dear brewer; My daughter is getting married in the coming weeks.
    As is traditional, I would like to provide her and her new husband with a month\u2019s
    worth of mead \u2013 their honey moon. Could you prepare that for me? I will
    need at least 10L of Average Alcohol mead. My daughter likes fruit tastes, so
    could you please make sure it has some Citrus, Sour and Tart flavours? Also make
    sure it has High Sweetness, to represent the sweetness of young love."
