  tutorialName: The Sales Counter
  tutorialText: Here you will find the Sales Counter. There are 4 Sales Positions,
    on which you can place any finished, Stored mead. While carrying a Bottle, Keg
    or Barrel, simply press E while looking at any of the positions. After a short
    period of time, someone will buy the mead it will be replaced by a pile of gold
    coins! Press E to pick them up. The open market is constantly in flux. Check
    what Flavours are currently Popular or Unpopular by Examining (Press R) the Market
    Ledger. Selling a mead with a Popular flavour will multiply your profits! Selling
    something with an Unpopular flavour, however, will result in a lower profit,
    potentially even a loss on the batch!
