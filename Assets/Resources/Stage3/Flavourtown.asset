  description: "Hey Brewer! I\u2019m looking for a majorly complex mead. Something
    that hits lots of notes at once. Can you make me at least 25L of mead? It should
    have High Sweetness, Strong Sour, Subtle Citrus, Subtle Peppery, Strong Woody,
    Average Floral and Strong Earthy flavours. I know it sounds crazy, but I want
    to take the mead train all the way to Flavourtown! I don\u2019t care what Alcohol
    content it has."

    a taste sensation but you just didn\u2019t deliver. What a shame."
  passText: "Wow oh wow! This is flavourlicious! It\u2019s like a party in my mouth
    and a crowd of people who neither know nor like each other all attended! Great
    job, brewer."
