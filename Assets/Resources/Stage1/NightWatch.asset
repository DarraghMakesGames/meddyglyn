  description: "Brewer \u2013 I am one of the night watchmen in the city guard. My
    post gets a bit boring. Could you craft me some mead to drink on those long,
    cold nights to keep me warm? Please keep it Low in Alcohol so I stay alert, and
    can you give it Average Sour and Average Tart flavours so the taste is sharp
    enough to keep me awake? 3L should be enough for the week."

    Somehow, drinking it made the nights feel even longer. Oh, cruel fate."
  passText: "This stuff is fantastic! The night watch flies by drinking this. I doubt
    my supervisor would agree, but I couldn\u2019t be happier!"
