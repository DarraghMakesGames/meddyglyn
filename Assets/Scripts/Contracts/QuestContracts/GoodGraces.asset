  description: 'Greetings, brewer. I am Ser Reginal, Chamberlain of the castle. His
    Grace the Duke has requested that you, as a new business owner in his city, prepare
    a sample of your work. He has requested a brew with an Average Alcohol content
    (6-10%), and a strong Tart flavour. Her Grace the Duchess has a strong dislike
    for Sour tastes. Please do not include ingredients with that flavour. We require
    that you present at least 3L of this brew. I look forward to a speedy fulfilment
    of this request. '

  failureText: "This is truly disappointing. His Grace requires business owners in
    Matzig to rise to a higher standard. Your brewer\u2019s license has been relegated
    to a Probationary status until such a time as you can produce a brew to the Duke\u2019s
    standards."
  passText: "It is my pleasure to relate the Duke and Duchess\u2019 thanks to you.
    They were quite pleased with your handiwork; they even saw fit to share a glass
    with the Duchess of Reizveld on her recent diplomatic visit. Though the meeting
    itself ended poorly, the mead was well received. As a local Matzig business owner,
    I feel I must inform you that war with Reizveld seems inevitable. However, your
    success must not go unrewarded. I have asked the cooper, Jarvik, to make his
    5L kegs available to you. This should make it easier to store and sell larger
    batches. His Grace also asked me to include a tankard from the royal kitchen
    as a sign of his thanks."
