  description: Greetings, novice meadmaker. I am Elphias, former master of the brewery
    you find yourself in. Before I pass the deed of ownership to you, you must prove
    yourself. Brew me a batch of mead. Combine honey, yeast and water in the brewing
    vessel, wait for it to finish fermenting, then bottle it. Bring the finished
    product to the wagon on the ground floor and mark this contract as complete at
    the Fulfilment Sign. If it is adequate, I will certify you as a brewer. I require
    only 1L (a single bottle) to judge the batch.

  failureText: 'It seems my faith in you was unfounded. You have failed to produce
    even the most basic mead. This is an insult. '
  passText: "This will suffice. You have much to learn, but I am satisfied that you
    won\u2019t bring ruin on the brewery immediately. You are officially registered
    as the owner of the brewery and a Mead Maker in good standing in the city of
    Matzig. Enclosed is a small sum of gold to help you get started. I\u2019ve also
    asked my friend Hubert, the local greengrocer, to supply you with some fruits
    to start flavouring your brews. Be aware \u2013 the local Duke requires all business
    owners to pay fees regularly to stay open. Make sure you have enough gold to
    pay the Duke!"
