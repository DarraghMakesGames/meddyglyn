  tutorialText: "On this table, you\u2019ll find the basic ingredients every batch
    of mead needs: honey, water, and yeast. Every batch must have all of these. How
    much honey you put in determines how Sweet the final mead will be. Your choice
    of yeast determines final Alcohol strength (5%, 10% or 15%). Make sure to put
    the water in last, as it will fill the vessel to the top and you won\u2019t be
    able to fit more ingredients! Press E to pick up any of these items. Honey and
    Yeast both cost gold, so choose carefully! While carrying one, press E while
    looking at the Brewing Vessel to put them in.  "
